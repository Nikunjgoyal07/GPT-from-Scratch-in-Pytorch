# 🧠 mini-gpt-from-scratch

A minimal GPT-style language model — built 100% from scratch in PyTorch — trained with Nvidia H200(141gb) with 90% utilization.  
Includes full custom implementations of **Self-Attention**, **Multi-Head Attention**, **Masked Self-Attention**, and the complete GPT architecture.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repo breaks down how a GPT works — piece by piece:
- **Self-Attention:** Learn how each token attends to others.
- **Multi-Head Attention:** Extend attention to multiple heads for richer representations.
- **Masked Attention:** Ensure the model predicts the next token without cheating.
- **Full GPT:** Assemble all blocks into a working generative language model.

I trained this GPT on a small Shakespeare dataset. Despite limited data, the model can generate short poetic lines that show the transformer’s power.

## 📚 How I Built It

- Started by understanding the original transformer paper.
- Broke it down into small parts: self-attention → multi-head → masking.
- Rebuilt the whole GPT block by block.
- Trained on Shakespeare’s text.
- Saved the final weights as `.pth`.
